# Ascension-to-the-Throne
Unpacker for Ascension to the Throne in Python. I am working on a repacker script but at the moment this tool merely extracts the files. You drag and drop the pak file onto the script. It will extract the files in the archive to the same folder so I suggest putting this script and your pak files in a separate folder to contain all the loose files.
